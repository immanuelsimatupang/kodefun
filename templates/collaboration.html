        <h4>About the Collaboration Hub</h4>
        <p>The Collaboration Hub is a space for KodeFun learners to connect with peers for group projects, coding challenges, or to discuss and develop new ideas. Working with others is a fantastic way to learn, share knowledge, and build your portfolio.</p>
        
        <h4>How it Works (Placeholder)</h4>
        <p>This section will detail how you can find collaborators or propose projects. Features might include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Project listings (ideas looking for collaborators).</li>
            <li>User profiles highlighting skills and interests for collaboration.</li>
            <li>Tools for forming teams or private group discussions.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Have a Project Idea?</h4>
        <p>If you have a project idea and are looking for team members, you'll soon be able to post it here. For now, consider sharing your idea in the <a href="{{ url_for('forum_index') }}">Community Forum</a> under "Project Show-off" or a relevant technology category.</p>
